# 👋 Hey there! I'm Sarthak Jain

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a Master’s student in **Electrical Engineering (Computer Architecture)** at **USC**, blending academic depth with over **4 years of hands-on experience** in **ASIC/FPGA design**, **RTL development**, and **hardware acceleration**.

I've had the privilege of working on **cutting-edge hardware systems** across both early-stage and startup-mode teams—at **Marquee Semiconductor**, where I optimized compute-heavy architectures, and **Baker Hughes**, where I developed fault-tolerant systems for industrial-grade deployments. Whether it’s building a **custom out-of-order CPU**, integrating **PCIe and DDR subsystems**, or scaling AI accelerators on **NetFPGAs**, I take pride in delivering **high-performance, timing-closed** hardware.

---

## 🚀 What Drives Me

I thrive at the intersection of architecture and implementation—**designing, debugging, and optimizing** systems from RTL to silicon. I love taking ownership across the stack, from **schematic design and validation**, to **hardware-software co-design**, **chip multiprocessor modeling**, and **GPGPU architecture simulation**.

> “I enjoy building things from scratch—whether it’s a Tomasulo-based CPU, a DMA-backed packet classifier, or a UVM-based verification testbench that breaks the system before production does.”

---

## 🎯 Actively Seeking:

I'm currently looking for **Fall 2025 Co-op / Full-Time roles** in:
- ✅ ASIC / FPGA Design  
- ✅ CPU / GPU Performance Modeling  
- ✅ RTL Design & Verification (SystemVerilog/UVM)  
- ✅ High-Performance Architecture & Simulation  
- ✅ Hardware Acceleration & Co-design

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack & Interests

- **Languages:** Verilog, SystemVerilog, C++, Python, TCL, VHDL  
- **Verification & Tools:** Vivado, Vitis, Synopsys VCS, QuestaSim, ModelSim, Cadence Virtuoso, ChipScope  
- **Simulation & Research:** GEM5, GPGPU-Sim, NetFPGA  
- **Protocols:** PCIe, AXI, AHB/APB, UART, SPI, I2C  
- **Concepts:** Out-of-order execution, Tomasulo’s algorithm, cache coherence (MOESI/MESIF), branch prediction, pipelining, memory systems, multicore design, async/sync FIFOs, DRAM architecture, CAM-based caching  

---

## 🎓 What I’m Studying at USC

Courses like **Advanced Computer Architecture**, **Network Processor Design**, and **Digital System Microarchitecture** are sharpening my edge in scalable computing and real-world systems design. I've ranked in the **top 3% of my class** and currently work as a **research assistant** on **AI-accelerated SmartNICs**.
